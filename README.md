# ObjectMap
ObjectMap is a simple **IoC container for .NET**. 

It started out as a practice exercise and an excuse to try out features of **C# 6**.

I have intentionally kept it as simple as possible for now since this isn't intended to be a full-fledged IoC container anyways. 

E.g. The service locator and container both reside in the same class ObjectMap.cs
