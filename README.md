# ObjectMap
ObjectMap is a simple **IoC container for .NET**. 

It started out as a practice exercise and an excuse to try out features of the **C# 6 preview**.

I have intentionally kept it as simple as possible for now since this isn't intended to be a full-fledged IoC container anyways. 

E.g. The service locator and container both reside in the same class ObjectMap.cs. So you can drop this file into your project and change it however you wish.
