# ObjectMap
ObjectMap is a simple **IoC container for .NET**. 

It started out as a [practice exercise](http://blog.mabenrob.in/post/objetmap-reinventing-the-wheel-learning-by-synthesis) and an excuse to try out features of the **C# 6 preview**.

I have intentionally kept it as simple as possible for now since this isn't intended to be a full-fledged IoC container anyways.
